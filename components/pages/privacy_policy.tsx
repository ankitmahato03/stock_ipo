            My application decisions are not influenced solely by GMP; I
            consider other factors. I confirm that I apply for IPOs only after
            consulting my SEBI registered advisor. I take full responsibility
            for any profits or losses resulting from my IPO investments. I
            acknowledge that IPO Ji App/Team does not recommend subscribing to
            or avoiding any IPO. I release IPO Ji App/Team from any claims or
            blame for investment losses. I affirm that applying for this IPO is
            my independent decision, and I am familiar with the company’s
            financial status. I will submit IPO applications solely for myself
            and my family’s accounts. I am accountable for any bids made on
            third-party accounts. I will verify my application number in the
            bids section of IPO Ji App before approving any UPI mandate. I am
            aware that applications through third-party banks/UPI may be
            rejected. I understand that HNI bids cannot be canceled; I may
            switch to retail bids. I acknowledge that cancelling an HNI bid to
            switch to retail will not be facilitated by the exchange. I take
            responsibility for cancelling bids with blocked payments. I have
            thoroughly read the RHP and possess comprehensive knowledge about
            the company I intend to invest in.
